* This project demonstrates how to manage runtime permissions in a Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) app for both Android and iOS.
* It uses shared code to define a common interface for permissions and platform-specific code to handle the actual logic.
* The project focuses on requesting and checking permissions without relying on external libraries.
* Contact permission is used as an example, but the approach works for any permission.
* Simple, reusable, and scalable for real-world multiplatform apps.
